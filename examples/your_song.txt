TITLE: Your Song
ARTIST: Elton John

[Verse 1]

  C                 F       G           Em
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
  Am              G            D       F
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
 C                   G      E           Am
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
 C              Dm         F             G
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
 C             F          G              Em
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Am              G             D           F
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
 C                G                 E          Am
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
 C             Dm         F             C
My gift is my song, and this one's for you


[Chorus]

  G                   Am     Dm           F
And you can tell everybody this is your song
  G          Am          Dm               F
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
 Am                      G
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
  Dm                 F
That I put down in words
  C             Dm       F                G      C F G F
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Verse 2]

 C             F    G             Em
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
 Am                   G            D                    F
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
 C               G         E                       Am
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
  C               Dm             F           G
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
C                 F       G                 Dm
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
 Am               G                 D                 F
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
  C            G        E             Am
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
   C               Dm         F      C
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


[Chorus]

  G                Am        Dm          F
And you can tell everybody this is your song
  G        Am            Dm               F
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
 Am                     G
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
  D                  F
That I put down in words
  Em             F       G                Am
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Outro]

 Am                     G
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
  D               F
That I put down in words
  Em            F        G                Am
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
