[Verse]

Gm          C           Dm
City of stars, are you shining just for me?
Gm          C               F
City of stars, there's so much that I can't see
    Gm        C                         F         Am       Adim
Who knows, I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
     Gm       A7                             Dm  Dm
That now our dreams, they've finally come true

[Verse]

Gm             C7                        Dm  Dm
City of stars, just one thing everybody wants
Gm             C7                          F              Am
There in the bars and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
     Gm       C                           F            Am     Adim
It's love, yes all we're looking for is love from someone else
  Gm                   A7
A rush, a glance, a touch, a dance

[Chorus]

   Bb                   C                    A7
A look in somebody's eyes to light up the skies
             Dm
To open the world and send it reeling
    Bb                        C7                   Dm  Dm
A voice that says I'll be here and you'll be alright
Bb                    C                   A7
I don't care if I know just where I will go
                  Dm
'Cause all that I needâ€™s this crazy feeling
  Bb                  A7
A rat-tat-tat on my heart
                   Dm  Dm
Think I want it to stay

[Outro]

Gm             C                         F  F
City of stars, are you shining just for me?
Gm             A7                        Dm
City of stars, you never shined so brightly
