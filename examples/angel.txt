I've got an angel
 C                  Am
She doesn't wear any wings
 F           Dm
She wears a heart that can melt my own
             G                            C
She wears a smile that can make me wanna sing
             C
She gives me presents
C                Am
With her presence alone
 F           Dm
She gives me everything I could wish for
              G
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

               C
She could make angels
C                    Am
I've seen it with my own eyes
F             Dm
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
            G                             C
Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

            Dm                   G
But you're so busy changing the world
          Dm                              G
Just one smile and you can change all of mine

                   C
We share the same soul
C        Am
Oh oh oh ohhh
                   C
We share the same soul
C        Am
Oh oh oh ohhh
                   C
We share the same soul
C        Am
Oh oh oh ohhh
             F
Oh oh oh oh ohhh
Dm             C
Umm umm umm uhhhhhhmm
